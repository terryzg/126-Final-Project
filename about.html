    <h3> Anthony's experience: </h3>
        <p>Anthony has spent over a decade mastering the art of lawn care and landscaping. Growing up in a small town where perfectly manicured lawns were a source of pride, he developed an early passion for creating beautiful outdoor spaces. After graduating with a degree in Environmental Horticulture, Anthony worked for some of the top landscaping companies in the region before founding his own business, Terry and Anthony Lawn Care LLC.

    <h3>Terry's Experience:</h3><p>
        Terry is a seasoned lawn care professional with a knack for turning even the roughest yards into lush, green paradises. Starting as a part-time summer job during high school, Terry quickly discovered a passion for working outdoors and seeing instant results from his hard work.
Over the past 15 years, Terry has built a name for himself by specializing in lawn restoration, irrigation system optimization, and turf health management. He believes in a "soil-first" approach ‚Äî making sure every lawn is healthy from the roots up.
